        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>Where am i?</h3>
        <p>Crackmes.de does not exists anymore. Reversers need to find a place to upload their creation and help new people to learn from that great discipline. This place has been made in order to help you to improve your reversing skills. You can download some crackmes and submit solutions to them.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
        <p>Obviously, all crackmes available on this website have been made to be cracked.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>I downloaded a crackme but it's password-protected.</h3>
        <p>The password for the files is "<b>crackmes.one</b>". If it does not work, this is probably because the crackme has been imported from crackmes.de, so use the password "<b>crackmes.de</b>" instead.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>I submitted a crackme/solution but it does not appear on the website.</h3>
        <p>Every crackme/solution is validated before appearing on the website. This may take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Some crackmes does not have any kind of information.</h3>
        <p>Indeed, but in most cases there's a README/instructions file within the archive.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How can I submit a solution.</h3>
        <p>First, you must login/register. Then, you can upload your solution on the crackme page. Text, markdown, HTML, and similar formats are preferred, but if you think that a video will be clearer, feel free to upload it!</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Can I use those crackmes as free course material?</h3>
        <p>All crackmes available on this site can be used for non-commercial purposes. But please mention the author. :)</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>My solution does not appear on the website after many days!</h3>
        <p>This is probably because your solution got rejected. Please, upload an explanation of how you managed to solve the crackme, not just a simple keygen.py file. More generally there's only one rule: don't patch! Unless the author explicitly said that patching is a valid solution, don't do it. Write your keygen, write your solution. You'll learn more by doing this.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How do I reset my password?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately there is no way to do it through the website. Please email crackmesone@gmail.com from the email you used when you registered the account for help</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>How do I reach out?</h3>
        <p>You can reach out to us via crackmesone@gmail.com</p>
